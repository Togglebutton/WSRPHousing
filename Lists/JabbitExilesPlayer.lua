		description = "The Hyper Grismarian Gigglesnorter is an alcoholic beverage invented by accident whilst developing the Immortality serum, considered by any who have ever drank it to be the “Best Drink in Existence.” Outlawed when an enclave was destroyed because too many party goers decided it would be fun to play contagion in the street. It is said that just one glass can knock you into orbit, so where do you find it?\nThe only place in existence known to serve this delightful beverage is on the surface of asteroid X579 \“The Rollin’ Rock\” orbiting Nexus. In a bustling town, filled with bright lights and dark secrets. Where patrons work hard and play harder. Guarded by the infamous statue of the Aurin Pirate, Cap’n Blackpaw, is a bar, “The Red Herring”. Whatever you enjoy, fine conversation in the courtyard, watching our resident band and special guests on stage, or just getting your brains mashed by our trademark brew, you will find it all in the Red Herring.\nRegular transports from Thayd have been arranged so you don’t have to drink-fly home! I urge you not to buy merchandise from the clones on the landing pad, and instead save your money for the opening night ahead!",
